Green Building – Sustainable – Resilient Success
Sustainable Design

What is green building? Sustainable design, or “green construction,” is a method of wisely using resources to create high-quality, healthier and more energy-efficient homes and commercial buildings. A green building is more than the sum of its parts (think resource conservation)—its process and impacts matter, too.

Materials

Sustainable design is about finding that balance between high-quality construction and low environmental impact. A lighter footprint means a longer-lasting planet, which is a win for the builder, client, and environment. Green building is a goal and a process. Viewing sustainable building as a process is important, because green-building success isn’t just a matter of building with green materials. Green building combines both materials and processes to maximize efficiency, durability and savings.
