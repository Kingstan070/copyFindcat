The fluid-structure interaction of solid objects freely falling in a Newtonian fluid was investigated numerically by direct-forcing immersed boundary (DFIB) method. The Navierâ€“Stokes equations are coupled with equations of motion through virtual force to describe the motion of solid objects. Here, we rigorously derived the equations of motion by taking control-volume integration of momentum equation. The method was validated by a popular numerical test example describing the 2D flow caused by the free fall of a circular disk inside a tank of fluid, as well as 3D experimental measurements in the sedimentation of a sphere. Then, we demonstrated the method by a few more 2D sedimentation examples: (1) free fall of two tandem circular disks showing drafting, kissing and tumbling phenomena; (2) sedimentation of multiple circular disks; (3) free fall of a regular triangle, in which the rotation of solid object is significant; (4) free fall of a dropping ellipse to mimic the falling of a leaf. In the last example, we found rich falling patterns exhibiting fluttering, tumbling, and chaotic falling.
