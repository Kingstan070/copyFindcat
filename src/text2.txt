Catching Specific Exceptions in Python

In the above example, we did not mention any specific exception in the except clause.

This is not a good programming practice as it will catch all exceptions and handle every case in the same way. We can specify which exceptions an except clause should catch.

A try clause can have any number of except clauses to handle different exceptions, however, only one will be executed in case an exception occurs.

We can use a tuple of values to specify multiple exceptions in an except clause. Here is an example pseudo code.
