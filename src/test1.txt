Overview

 Department of Civil Engineering
What do Architectural Engineers, Civil Engineers and Construction Managers do? 

Architectural engineers use their knowledge of architecture and engineering to direct and coordinate building activities at construction sites or activities related to production, operations, quality assurance, testing, or maintenance at manufacturing sites. Civil engineers conceive, design, supervise and maintain infrastructure projects and systems such as roads, buildings, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and systems for water supply and sewage treatment. Construction managers coordinate and supervise the building of all types of structures, as well as roads, memorials and bridges.

Scholarships
The Department of Civil Engineering enjoys strong support from local industry and alumni, and that support is demonstrated through the number of scholarships we can offer undergraduate students. All scholarships are awarded on a competitive basis. The amount, deadline, duration, and award criteria vary among the types of awards available to the students. Students are strongly encouraged to carefully review the application criteria and comply with all relevant policies and procedures when applying for these scholarships.
Ph.D. Program Pre-Application 
The preliminary application gives the Department of Civil Engineering a rough and unofficial idea of your credentials, background, test scores, degrees, universities attended, GPAs, and the courses you have taken. It also helps us decide whether we should encourage you to formally apply. Its benefit to you is we can see whether you are a competitive candidate, and you can save money on the application fee if and until we ask you to formally apply. There is no fee for the preliminary application.
The preliminary application cannot be used as your official application to the University of Texas at Arlington. You must formally apply with the Graduate School by the admissions deadline and pay an application fee to be formally considered.

About Our Academic Programs
The Civil Engineering Department is one of the most productive and progressive academic units in the College of Engineering. We are first in the College with respect to research expenditures per faculty. Our enrollment is over 1600 students. The faculty, staff, and students have transformed the department to a new level of excellence in research and teaching that directly addresses local and national engineering needs by providing innovative solutions to the most challenging problems facing our nation's infrastructure.
The objective of the graduate program in civil engineering is to prepare students for continued professional and scholarly development consistent with their technical interests. Students, with the assistance of a faculty advisor in their area of interest, plan their programs of study in one of the technical areas in civil engineering.
Fast Track Program for a Master’s Degree in Civil Engineering
The Fast Track Program enables outstanding senior undergraduate Civil Engineering students to receive undergraduate and graduate credit for up to six hours of coursework. Technical electives which are dual-listed as graduate courses will satisfy both bachelor’s and master’s degree requirements. Students pursuing an MECE or MSCE degree may take up to two courses for dual credit.
Interested undergraduate Civil Engineering students should apply for admission to the Fast Track Program when they are within 30 hours of completing their bachelor’s degree (and before graduation).
Civil Engineering B.S.-Ph.D. Program
The Civil Engineering department offers a B.S.-Ph.D. Program.
