A civil engineer's jobs is to design, construct and maintain roads, bridges,
airports, tunnels, buildings, dams, water supply systems, sewerage systems,
hydro-electric projects and pretty much everything that constitutes infrastructure.
Construction : Construction engineering involves the planning and execution,
transportation of materials, site development on hydraulic, environmental,
structural and geotechnical engineering.
Environment Preservation : Environmental engineers administer pollution
reduction, industrial ecology, and green engineering. They help us understand
the consequences of our actions on the environment.
Urban Development : Civil engineering plays a crucial role in the development
of underground utility networks, the distribution of electrical and
telecommunication networks, bus service networks, and more.
Water Resources Management : They predict and manage both quantity and
