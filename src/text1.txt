A language model is a statistical model that captures relevant linguistic features of the corpus on which it is trained. At a basic level, it should capture the frequency distribution of letters and words. A more advanced language model should capture syntactic and grammatical dependencies, such as agreement and inflection, and semantic properties, such as which words are likely to occur in a given context. Language models are typically used for two main tasks: scoring and generation. In scoring, the language model gives a probability score to a certain word occurring in a given context. Given the context machine learning is ____ , it should hopefully give a higher score to the completion fun than to the completion octopus , assuming it is trained on a representative sample of English text. In generation, the model samples from the learned distribution to generate fake but plausible-sounding text. Claude Shannon discussed language models in his seminal 1948 paper, and the ability to assign a probability to a sequence of words is a great achievement of information theory.
